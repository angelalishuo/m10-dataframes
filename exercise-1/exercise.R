# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")

points <- c(12, 3, 37, 27)


# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games

points.allowed <- c(10, 9, 18, 17)
# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe

my.data <- data.frame(points, points.allowed)
# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points

my.data$diff <- my.data$points - my.data$points.allowed
# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom

my.data$won <- my.data$diff > 0
# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c("Dolphins", "Rams", "49ers", "Jets")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(my.data) <- opponents
